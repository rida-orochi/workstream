/*
-Authorship: Rida Allah Jaija,Aymane Hasini,
-Purpose:For our project, we are going to develop of a software tool that assists engineers and project managers
 in evaluating the economic feasibility of different projects.
 What this tool will do is to allow users to input data such as initial costs, expected revenues, and operating expenses,
 and then use this data to calculate indicators like the present worth, internal rate of return ( percentage i), and payback period.
 The program will also give users the opportunity to compare multiple projects and choose the most viable one based on their economic performance.
 To implement this tool, we plan to use the data structures we have studied in class such as graphs, queues, and tables to represent and analyze the financial data.Â
